# Multi Factor based Nutrient Management and Recipe Recommendation System

## Abstract

Nutrient management in the context of this project aims to quantize the consumption of essential nutrients in an efficient format such that it leads to a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Increased consciousness towards one’s health has recently been in the limelight which creates the need for an intelligent system specially customized for the individual that can analyze your consumption’s quality and suggest options that could essentially fulfill your body’s need to lead a healthy lifestyle.

The project's main goal is to create an intelligent recipe recommender that would aid in the development of a diet that allows all users to make healthy choices in their daily lives while still enjoying food and keeping healthy. The recommender system, once implemented as a mobile or web application, can help users who have nutritional deficiencies to maintain a healthy well balanced diet by suggesting various recipes to the users in video format with additional relevant information which will improve the user’s well-being and quality of life.
