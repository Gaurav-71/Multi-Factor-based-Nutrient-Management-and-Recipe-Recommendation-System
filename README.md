# Multi-Factor-based-Nutrient-Management-and-Recipe-Recommendation-System
Nutrient management in the context of this project aims to quantize the consumption of essential nutrients in an efficient format such that it leads to a healthy and balanced lifestyle. Several recent studies have shown the importance of quality-based consumption of nutrients which could otherwise lead to serious health issues that could even be fatal at times. The emergence of advanced scientific methods to determine the presence of various nutrients or lack thereof has led to widespread awareness amongst individuals to keep a track of their nutrient consumption. Increased consciousness towards one’s health has recently been in the limelight which creates the need for an intelligent system specially customized for the individual that can analyse your consumption’s quality and suggest options that could essentially fulfil your body’s need to lead a healthy lifestyle. The presence of this particular system can hugely impact individuals as this would save a considerable amount of time in finding a recipe that would not only suit the user’s preference but also encapsulate all the nourishing factors that an individual would require.
