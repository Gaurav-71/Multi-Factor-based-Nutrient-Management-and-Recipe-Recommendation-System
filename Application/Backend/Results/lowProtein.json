    "summary": "Forget going out to eat or ordering takeout every time you crave Mediterranean food. Try making Mini eggplant pizzan at home. One serving contains 240 calories, 12g of protein, and 21g of fat. For 70 cents per serving, this recipe covers 7% of your daily requirements of vitamins and minerals. This recipe serves 3. 1 person has made this recipe and would make it again. This recipe from Foodista requires pepperoni, sea salt, eggplant, and cheese. From preparation to the plate, this recipe takes around around 45 minutes. It is a good option if you're following a gluten free and primal diet. Overall, this recipe earns a rather bad spoonacular score of 18%. Similar recipes are Mini Eggplant Parmesan, Mini Eggplant Crust Pizzas, and Mini Eggplant Parm, Roasted Cherry Tomato, Basil Pesto.Sangiovese, Barbera Wine, and Shiraz are my top picks for Pizza. The best wine for pizza depends on the toppings! Red sauce pizza will call for a red wine with some acidity, such as a barberan or sangiovese. Add pepperoni or sausage and you can go bolder with a syrah. The Tenuta di Arceno Stradan al Sasso Chianti Classico Gran Selezione with a 4.3 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 50 dollars per bottle.\nTenuta di Arceno Strada al Sasso Chianti Classico Gran Selezione\n2015 was the perfect warm vintage- not too hot, just right. The nose immediately releases tones of honeysuckle and strawberry jam, finishing with a herbal tone of rosemary and cypress. On the palate, the power of this wine impresses. There is an explosion of flavors, all framed tightly by firm bright acids. Flavors are dominated by tart cranberries and raspberries, giving way to the ever-elusive lush blueberry tones. The finish is dominated by vanilla bean with lingering black pepper and orange peel. This is an exciting year for Sangiovese and has the potential to age 15\u201320 years.\n\n\u00bb Get this wine on Wine.com",

Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Gr\u00fcner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Rabble Pinot Gris. Reviewers quite like it with a 4.9 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 18 dollars per bottle.\nRabble Pinot Gris\nLate morning fog, continually cool days and chilling afternoon winds add to a delicate yet flavorful wine. This Pinot Gris has a light golden color and a complex, fruit-scented nose that revealslayers of mango, jasmine tea, cinnamon, and cantaloupe. Smooth, light toasted walnut and honey balance the fruits, and give way to a crisp, lingering finish full of freshly cut grass and peaches.\n\n\u00bb Get this wine on Wine.com",
