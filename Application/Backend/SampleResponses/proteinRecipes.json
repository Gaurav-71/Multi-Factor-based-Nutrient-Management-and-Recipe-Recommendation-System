    "instruction": "For the brine, combine the water, salt, sugar, half of the dried herbs and bay leaves into a large saucepan. Bring the mixture to a boil, stirring to dissolve the salt and sugar. Reduce to heat to low and simmer for 10 min so the flavors of the herbs can be drawn out. Pour the brine into a deep set large bowl and cool it down with your ice water. Set aside.Clean the chicken by rinsing out the cavity and outer skin and place on a clean surface. Be sure not to contaminate any vegetables or other ingredients, because no one is a fan of salmonella! Place the chicken in the brine, make sure it is completely immersed in the brine. Cover and allow to marinate for at least an hour and up to 6 hours.Preheat the oven to 375F.Remove the chicken from the brine and place on a clean surface. Pat the chicken dry with a paper towel as shown. Separate the skin from the flesh, you can do this by carefully inserting your fingers underneath the skin and gently pull up to create a space or pocket. Take the butter and rub it underneath the skin and flesh this will make your chicken moist and tender while accentuating the flavor of the herbs in the meat. Coat the skin with te remaining herbs and place in a roasting pan, if more herbs are needed just add more.Bake the chicken for about 1 hour and 10 minutes, basting the chicken half way through and again during the last 10 minutes. To test the doneness of your chicken, insert a meat thermometer into the thickest part of the breast, it should read 165F. If you do not own a thermometer, cut into the chicken and if it releases pink juices it is undercooked. Your chicken is done when the juices are a clear yellow.Transfer the chicken to a carving board and allow it to rest for 10-20 minutes. This allows the juices to settle into the meat so it does not end up running out all over the board. To serve, begin carving the legs it is easiest to cut at the joints. Remove the wings and then the legs and thighs the same way. To carve each breast, start at the breabone and cut downward and parallel to the rib cage. Then make a deep horizontal cut right above the thigh and wing joints. You can choose to serve the breasts whole or cut them into thin slices.",

Just before youre ready to serve, uncover the saucepan and increase the heat to reduce the sauce to the desired thickness.For the lentil pilaf bring the water to boil, then add the remaining ingredients, stir, cover and reduce heat to low. Allow to cook for at least 20 minutes before lifting the lid to check consistency. When done, all the liquid should have been absorbed by the rice/lentils, which should be soft.Serve the meatballs and the sauce on a bed of the lentil rice with a big dollop of yoghurt.",

    "instruction": "In a large wok or fryingpan, heat the oil, garlic, ginger and pepper flakes over low heat for 5-6 minutes. Do not allow garlic to burn! You just want to infuse the oil.In the meantime, tenderize your meat by placing the chicken breast in between two pieces of plastic wrap. Beat it with a meat tenderizer or rolling pin and flatten to about inch thick. Slice into inch strips.Bring another pot of water to boil (enough to cook the noodles)Turn the heat up to medium and add the chicken. Stir constantly, but allow meat to brown. When meat is about half way cooked, add the hoisin sauce, soy sauce and brown sugar. Cook meat thoroughly then remove from heat.Add the broccoli and cook for 5 minutes.Once the pot of water is boiling, add the noodles and cook for about 7-8 minutes. Should be slightly al dente.After 5 minutes, add the chicken back into the wok with the broccoli and cook for another 2-3 minutes. When the noodles are done, drain, and quickly add to the chicken and broccoli dish. Remove the wok from dish once the noodles absorb the liquid. Add the teaspoon of toasted sesame oil. Serve and enjoy!",
