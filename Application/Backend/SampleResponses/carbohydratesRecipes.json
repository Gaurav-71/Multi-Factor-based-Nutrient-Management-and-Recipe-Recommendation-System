For $1.92 per serving, this recipe covers 18% of your daily requirements of vitamins and minerals. 7 people have tried and liked this recipe. This recipe from Foodista requires honey, water, garlic, and brown sugar. Not a lot of people really liked this Southern dish. From preparation to the plate, this recipe takes about about 45 minutes. With a spoonacular score of 41%, this dish is good. Try Korean Extra Crispy Fried Chicken, Extra Crispy Spicy Fried Chicken, and Extra-Crispy Spicy Fried Chicken with \u201cDelta\u201d Sauce for similar recipes.Fried Chicken works really well with Riesling, Sparkling Wine, and Zinfandel. In general, there are a few rules that will help you pair wine with southern food. Food-friendly riesling or sparkling white wine will work with many fried foods, while zinfandel is great with barbecued fare. The Selbach Oster Zeltinger Himmelreich Riesling Kabinett Halbtrocken with a 4 out of 5 star rating seems like a good match. It costs about 21 dollars per bottle.\nSelbach Oster Zeltinger Himmelreich Riesling Kabinett Halbtrocken\n#95 Wine Spectator Top 100 of 2017 It\u2019s richer and less minty than usual but I like the richness in this vintage, which can use a little gras; so anticipate a wine with more apple and less spearmint; crunchy stuff. The parcel is called Heel and it\u2019s to the right of Anrecht, from which one of the great trio of en-bloc wines comes.\n\n\u00bb Get this wine on Wine.com",
